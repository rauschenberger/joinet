Title: Penalised Multivariate Regression ('Multi-Target Learning')
Description: Implements penalised multivariate regression (i.e., for multiple outcomes and many features) by stacked generalisation (Rauschenberger and Glaab 2021 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab576>). For positively correlated outcomes, a single multivariate regression is typically more predictive than multiple univariate regressions. Includes functions for model fitting, extracting coefficients, outcome prediction, and performance measurement. For optional comparisons, install MRCE or remMap from GitHub (<https://github.com/cran/MRCE>, <https://github.com/cran/remMap>).
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)
